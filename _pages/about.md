* In Fall 2025, I will be a postdoc in the [School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/math). Then in Summer 2026, I will join the [Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) Department at Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) as an assistant professor.
* I received my Ph.D. from [UC Berkeley](http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/) in Spring 2025, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Avishay Tal](http://www.avishaytal.org/).
* My research interests lie in the general area of theoretical computer science, with a recent focus on provable quantum advantages, Boolean function analysis, and quantum cryptography. 

* My name written in Chinese is *吴克文*. You may pronounce *Kewen* as *Kevin*.

* The photo on the left is me catching [marble trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmo_marmoratus) in [Soča](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%C4%8Da), Slovenia. 

* I don't use social media like Twitter, Zhihu, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them before.
