* I'm a fourth-year graduate student in [the theory group of UC Berkeley](http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/). **I plan to graduate next year and look for postdoc positions.**
* I'm very lucky to have [Avishay Tal](http://www.avishaytal.org/) be my advisor.
* My research interests lie in the general area of theoretical computer science, with a recent focus on provable quantum advantages, Boolean function analysis, and quantum cryptography. 

* My name written in Chinese is *吴克文*. You may pronounce *Kewen* as *Kevin*.

* I don't use social media like Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them before.
