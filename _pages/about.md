* I'm a first-year graduate student in UC Berkeley.
* I'm very lucky to have [Avishay Tal](http://www.avishaytal.org/) be my advisor.
* My research interests lie in the general area of theoretical computer science, particularly complexity theory, data structures & algorithms, cryptography, as well as their interplay and connection with mathematics.

* My name written in Chinese is Âê¥ÂÖãÊñ? The pronunciation of *Kewen* is *Kevin*.
