* I'm a first-year graduate student in [the theory group of UC Berkeley](http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/).
* I'm very lucky to have [Avishay Tal](http://www.avishaytal.org/) be my advisor.
* My research interests lie in the general area of theoretical computer science, particularly complexity theory, data structures & algorithms, cryptography, as well as their interplay and connection with mathematics.

* My name written in Chinese is *吴克文*. You may pronounce *Kewen* as *Kevin*.

* I don't use social media like Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them before.
